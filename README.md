# 🛍️ Customer-Segmentation-with-K-Nearest-Neighbors


This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm to segment mall customers into value-based groups (Low, Medium, High). A **Streamlit web app** is included for real-time prediction based on user inputs like age, gender, income, and spending score.
